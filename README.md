# Monitor Control via NVidia API

Send commands to monitor over I2C using NVapi. This can be used to issue VCP commands or other manufacturer specific commands.

## Quick Start

**The NVidia API is now included as a git submodule - no separate download needed!**

1. **Clone with submodules:**
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive <your-repo-url>
   # Or if already cloned:
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Build:**
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake .. -A x64
   cmake --build . --config Release
   ```

3. **Run:**
   ```bash
   ./bin/Release/writeValueToDisplay.exe 0 0x32 0x10  # Set brightness to 50%
   ```

## Build System

This project now uses **CMake** for cross-platform builds and better dependency management:
- ‚úÖ Automatic architecture detection (x64/x86)
- ‚úÖ Integrated NVidia API linking  
- ‚úÖ Organized project structure
- ‚úÖ Ready for GUI development

### History 
This program was created after discovering that my display does not work with <b>ControlMyMonitor</b> to change inputs using VCP commands. Searching for an antlernative lead me to this thread https://github.com/rockowitz/ddcutil/issues/100 where other users had found a way to switch the inputs of their LG monitors using a linux program, I needed a windows solution. That lead to the NVIDIA API, this program is an adaptation of the i2c example code provided in the API

## Usage

### Syntax
```
writeValueToDisplay.exe <display_index> <input_value> <command_code> [register_address]
```

| Argument | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| display_index | Index assigned to monitor by OS (Typically 0 for first screen, try running "mstsc.exe /l" in command prompt to see how windows has indexed your display(s)) |
| input_value   | value to write to screen |
| command_code  | VCP code or other|
| register_address | Address to write to, default 0x51 for VCP codes |



## Example Usage
Change display 0 brightness to 50% using VCP code 0x10
```
writeValueToDisplay.exe 0 0x32 0x10 
```
<br>

Change display 0 input to HDMI 1 using VCP code 0x60 on supported displays
```
writeValueToDisplay.exe 0 0x11 0x60 
```

### Change input on some displays
Some displays do not support using VCP codes to change inputs. I have tested this using values from this thread https://github.com/rockowitz/ddcutil/issues/100 with my LG Ultragear 27GP850-B. Your milage may vary with other monitors, <b>use at your own risk!</b>

#### Change input to HDMI 1 on LG Ultragear 27GP850-B
NOTE: LG Ultragear 27GP850-B is display 0 for me
```
writeValueToDisplay.exe 0 0x90 0xF4 0x50
```

#### Change input to Displayport on LG Ultragear 27GP850-B
NOTE: LG Ultragear 27GP850-B is display 0 for me
```
writeValueToDisplay.exe 0 0xD0 0xF4 0x50
```
